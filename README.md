# Rosh

- Feel free to take inspiration for learning purposes! (<3 if you credit :D)
- Altough this project is open-source, please avoid copying certain features and claiming them as your own.

### Setup
- It is required to edit the ```server.properties``` config file in your BDS folder and add the following line: ```op-permission-level=2``` (minimum=2, maximum=4)
- Here's a link to the official Bedrock Dedicated Server Software:

- While Realms and local worlds would technically work it is advised to not use Rosh there as some checks would be rendered unfunctional.
